# HubView

A tiny iPad app for viewing and commenting on commits!

## Build

Build using `HubView.xcworkspace`, *not* `HubView.xcodeproj`. Otherwise,
CocoaPods will not be brought in correctly.

## Disclaimer

I am a terrible, terrible Objective-C developer. Be warned. Reading this code
might lower your IQ, cause you to no longer be friends with me, and force you
into watching old reruns of Boy Meets World to alleviate your pain.

But here's some emoji to make you feel better :heart: :boom: :zap: :tada: :shipit:
